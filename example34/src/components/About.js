                <p> Sure, you can probably find a peach at the grocery store year-round. But it’s probably not very good—it
                     lacks flavor, is likely a little mealy, and certainly not juicy. Grab a sweet
                     Georgia peach when they’re in season during June and your life will change for the better,
                      bite by bite.</p>
